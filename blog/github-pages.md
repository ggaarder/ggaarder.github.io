Download the requirements as described on Jekyll's documentation to test your blog locally, since it takes time waiting the server to build.

1. Download and Install a Ruby+Devkit.

Whether you use the Ruby installer to install MSYS or reuse a pre-installed one, it needs to download seemingly the same stuff to update. So I used my pre-installed one.

2. Install Jekyll and Bundler via: ```gem install jekyll bundler```

```chcp 65001``` to change codepage into UTF-8 when using MSYS.
