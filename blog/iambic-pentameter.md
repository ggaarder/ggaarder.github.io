On debugging XKCDD I saw 79: Iambic Pentameter.

> ## Explanation
> In this part of the My Hobby series, the hobby is responding to casual questions using iambic pentameter. Iambic pentameter is a form of poetic verse defined by the number of syllables per line. In this form, a line contains exactly five (penta means five in Greek) "iambs" per line. An iamb is a unit of two syllables with the stress falling on the second. The actual breakup of the words is unimportant; the definition is based solely on the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. One line of strict iambic pentameter will have ten syllables, with the stress falling on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and last.

> In this comic, Cueball (i.e. Randall - the one with the hobby) is replying to his friend's questions. (The friend also looks like Cueball, but are here differentiated by who has the hobby.) Cueball's responses are each one line of iambic pentameter, just visually broken into two lines for space reasons. They read (adding the emphasis):
>
> > "Well, *I* can *meet* the *plane* at *ten* of *six*" and
> > "I'll *meet* him *at* the *stairs* be*fore* the *gate*",
> > with a sort of bouncing rhythm.

I suddenly realized why my "put your mother-f\*\*king hand out of my book" (to Ankle Breaker) sounded so funny. LOL. I'm a genius.

I was imitating the old movie manner (like The Million Pound Bank Note and My Fair Lady). That's why.
