SVM:
- Classification of images
- image segmentation
- recognize hand-written characters
- mathematically prove that SVM also holds on higher dimensions (than
  two)
- `b/||w||` ?
- why 'the distance between these two hyperplanes is `2/||w||`' ?
- mathematically prove that '`w*xi - b >= 1` if and only if the point
  lies in the margin (so does `w*xi -b <= -1`)' also holds on higher
  dimensions (than two)
